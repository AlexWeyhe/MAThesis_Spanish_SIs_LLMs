# Title: Pragmatic Inference of Scalar Implicatures in Spanis by Large Language Models
## Student: Weyhe, alexander
## Supervisors: Zymla, Mark-Mathhias & Bade, Nadine

This Masters thesis investigates the capability of Large Language Models (LLM) to infer scalar implicatures in Spanish. In doing so, three different experiments were conducted:
  1. Computing surprisal scores of a sequence with one context sentence (whole or subset) and one target sentence (algunos or unos).
  2. Leveraging the Natural Language Inference (NLI) capabilities of LLMs with a target sentence (algunos or unos) as premise and a context sentence (whole or subset) as hypothesis.
  3. Directly prompting LLMs to retrieve acceptance ratings.

## Data
The data used for the experiments was constructed from the *Wortschatz Leipzig Corpus* (Goldhahn et al. 2012) and annotated to add context and target sentences.
