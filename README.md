# Title: Pragmatic Inference of Scalar Implicatures in Spanish by Large Language Models
## Student: Weyhe, Alexander
## Supervisors: Zymla, Mark-Matthias & Bade, Nadine

This Masters thesis investigates the capability of Large Language Models (LLM) to infer scalar implicatures in Spanish. In doing so, two different experiments were conducted:
  1. Computing surprisal scores of a sequence with one context sentence (whole or subset) and one target sentence (algunos or unos).
  2. Leveraging the Natural Language Inference (NLI) capabilities of LLMs with by emplyoing NLI finetune models.

## Data
The data used for the experiments was constructed from the *Wortschatz Leipzig Corpus* (Goldhahn et al. 2012) and annotated to add context and target sentences.
